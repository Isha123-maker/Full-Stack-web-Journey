      <h2>Why Women in Tech Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Women have made major contributions to the tech world—often  <b>without
        getting the spotlight they deserve</b>. From early pioneers like <b>Ada
        Lovelace</b> to today’s AI leaders, they’ve helped shape our digital future.
        Their ideas, innovations, and leadership bring diversity, creativity,
        and new problem-solving perspectives to the world of technology.
