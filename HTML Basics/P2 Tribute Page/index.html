        <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <p>
          Ada Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was an
          English mathematician and writer. She is chiefly known for her work on
          Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the
          Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized
          as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making
          her one of the first computer programmers.
        </p>

          Lovelace's contributions to computing were not fully recognized until
          much later, but today she is celebrated as a pioneer in the field of
          computer science. Her visionary ideas about the potential of computers
          to go beyond mere calculation laid the groundwork for future
          developments in technology.
